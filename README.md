# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Sign in to see the secret.

This project contains a sign in form that checks the username and password, in order to see the secret page.
username = username, password = pass.
This project was made to improve my knowledge of class components in react.
To display the pictures from the secret page, I used: Dog API https://dog.ceo/dog-api/about.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
